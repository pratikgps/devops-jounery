🚀 Kicking Off My DevOps Journey #LearnInPublic


Today, I’m starting something big in my DevOps journey where I’ll be learning, building projects, and sharing everything openly here on LinkedIn.



Why?
 Because the best way to grow is to Learn in Public – share what you’re learning, get feedback, and connect with others on the same path.



💡 My DevOps Journey will cover:
🐧 Linux & Shell scripting
🛠️ Git, GitHub & CI/CD pipelines
☁️ Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)
📦 Containers (Docker & Kubernetes)
🔐 Security, Monitoring, Infrastructure as Code, and more



📌 How I’ll share:

* Try to post weekly or twice in a week.
* Each week = topic + hands-on project + GitHub repo link (if applicable)
* Reflection + community question to spark discussions



✅ Goal: By the end of this journey, I’ll have a DevOps Portfolio of 50+ projects while helping others learn along the way.


👉 If you’re also learning DevOps (or working in it), let’s connect!
 Your feedback, tips, or even just encouragement will make this journey even better.
