- Creating and merging Pull Requests
- Resolving merge conflicts

## ðŸ“‚ Repo Content
- `README.md` â†’ This file
- `git-cheatsheet.txt` â†’ Quick reference for Git commands
- Practice files (`hello.txt`, etc.)

## âœ… Outcome
- Created my **first Pull Request** and successfully merged it ðŸŽ‰
- Learned how to handle merge conflicts with confidence
